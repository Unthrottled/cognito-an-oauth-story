A OAuth Story
----

- The search for the mystical social sign-in button

- How do I go from the social login button to having working security in my application?

- What are my requirements?
    - I want it to be secure and not hate myself while building the security.
    - I want to be able to support many social logins (facebook, amazon, google, github, etc.)
    
- How do I security?
    - Oh, you mean fancy JSON? 
    - Should be easy to expect.
    
- Social login buttons
    - Is this OAuth?
    - Is this JWT?
    
- What do you mean there is a difference between OAuth and OpenID? 
    - They have the social login buttons, why can't I use them?!
    
- How do I bridge the gap?
    - Is this Cognito?
    
- Why do I need Cognito?
    - What the heck is going on?
    
- Should I Cognito?
